Hi!!! This is the repository I will be using for my projects and coursework for **STATS220** in Semester One this year üòÑ

## Please follow along to witness: ##
* My journey as I learn more about coding! I have some prior experience using R and HTML but there is always more to learn
* Cool things I will make during the semester
* An excessive amount of cat photos and gifs üê± I love cats so expect to see a lot of references to them!
