Hi! This is the repository I will be using as a home for the projects and coursework I do in **STATS220** this semester üòÑ

## Please follow along to witness:
1. My journey as I learn more about coding! I have some prior experience using R and HTML, but there is always more to learn
2. Cool things I make during the semester
3. An excessive amount of cat photos and gifs üê± I love cats so expect to see a *lot* of references to them!

I am a **BHSc/BSc** conjoint student with an interest in biostatistics and epidemiology. I want to become an epidemiologist and data analyst, and in this increasingly digital world I think code will only make this easier and more interesting!

## Some more things I love include:
*(Not in any particular order)*
* Reading, especially historical fiction
* Trying to beat my PB (personal best) in the gym and rack up my listening minutes on Spotify üéß
* Anything to do with fashion, style, and personal expression
* My cat and cats in general

Here is a link to some [motivational gifs](https://giphy.com/explore/motivational) for myself and anyone else who needs it this semester!
