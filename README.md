Hi! This is the repository I will be using as a home for the projects and coursework I do in **STATS220** this semester 😄

## Please follow along to witness:
1. My journey as I learn more about coding! I have some prior experience using R and HTML, but there is always more to learn
2. Cool things I make during the semester
3. An excessive amount of cat photos and gifs 🐱 I love cats so expect to see a *lot* of references to them!

I am a **BHSc/BSc** conjoint student with an interest in biostatistics and epidemiology. I love data and want to become an epidemiologist! In this increasingly digital world, I think code can be so useful for helping us make sense of data and what we see around us.

## Some more things I love include:
*(Not in any particular order)*
* Reading, especially historical fiction
* Trying to beat my PB (personal best) in the gym and rack up my listening minutes on Spotify 🎵
* Anything to do with fashion, style, and personal expression
* My cat and cats in general

Here is a link to some [motivational gifs](https://giphy.com/explore/motivational) for myself and anyone else who needs it this semester!
